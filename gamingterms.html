                <h1>Gaming Terms</h1>
                    <h2>The gaming world is full of strange words and terms. At GG, we have collected a few to try and explain what they mean!</h2>
                        <p>1. GG. GG stands for “Good Game” and is a sign of sportsmanship after playing an online match against another player or team. It is good practice to say “GG” whether you win or lose to show your appreciation for the match and the opponents effort.</p>
                        <p>2.AFK. This stands for “Away From Keyboard”. This is used when a player is “in” a game or match but the person themself is not playing, or is “away from keyboard”. This means that it looks like they are there when they are really not. This is a big problem in online multiplayer games, so try not to abandon your computer if it might negatively impact your team!</p>

            <div class="articlecol">
                        <p>3. Nerf. Nerf is a term used to describe action taken by the game developer that decreases the effectiveness or power of a character or ability in a game. For example, if someone says “My favourite character got nerfed again!” or “such and such got a massive nerf!” it means that an ability or part of a game has been weakened, usually to make the game more fair or interesting. </p> 
                        <p>4. Buff. This is the opposite of nerf, and means to make it better or more effective. </p>

            <div class="articlecol">
                        <p>5. AOE. This stands for Area Of effect. It is usually used to describe the area that an ability, spell or similar has an effect on. For example if someone threw a poisonous potion on the ground, the AOE could be the area that is harmful for players to step on.</p>
                        <p>6. FPS. This is a First person shooter, a type of game. A first person shooter is exactly as it sounds. The player plays from the characters viewpoint, looking through their “eyes” and shooting is an important part of the gameplay. An FPS can be multiplayer or singleplayer. They often require skill with aim and reflexes.</p>
