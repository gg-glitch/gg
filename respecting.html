                <h1>Respecting Others</h1>
                    <h2>Here are some tips to have a positive experience with other players!</h2>
                        <p>1. Don’t trash talk. Trash talking is when one player insults or says negative things about another player. In a multiplayer game, this could be against someone in their team or in the other team. Trash talking might make the talker feel better and help rid of some frustration, but overall it makes the game worse. Teams will turn against each other and perform badly, and other players can be really hurt by your words. If someone is playing badly, trash talking will not make them want to improve; most likely they will only feel resentment, anger or shame and will refuse to change their ways. If you really want someone to do something differently, stop and consider why. Everyone has a right to play the game how they want to play it, as long as it follows the rules. If you still want to say something try and be encouraging and polite, and understand what it would be like to receive criticism.

                        <p>2. Accept different playstyles. This one is similar to the previous one, but different people play games in different ways. Some people like to play healing or support rules, some people like to play offensively, some people like to take things slow, some people are really competitive, some people like to play in easy mode and some people don’t care about being good at the game and just want to have fun. The gaming world is vast and unique, and accepting the differences between players will make your experience much more enjoyable.

                        <p>3. Don’t criticize skill. Skill is something that varies from player to player, and we all have different goals we are working towards. However, criticising someone for trying their best will not help in any situation. New players can’t be expected to be experts the minute they start! We are all at a different point on our gaming journey. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t offer to help or provide tips when the need arises, but make sure your help is wanted. At the end of the day gaming is about having fun!
