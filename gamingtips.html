                <h1>Gaming Tips</h1>
                    <h2>The gaming world is huge and hard to navigate, but there are some basic rules you can follow!</h2>
                        <p>1. Have fun!
                            This is by far the most important tip; it is easy to get caught up in being “good” at the game and forgetting about what really matters. Gaming is a hobby (unless you are playing professionally- even then, you should still enjoy it!) so it’s worth it to pause every once and awhile and check in with how you are feeling. Are you stressed about reaching the next level or rank, so much so that you are struggling to sleep and dread failure? Are you angry at the game or the team you are playing with? Are you playing a game simply because it’s popular? If you answer yes to these questions, try taking a step back and reevaluate the games you are playing and how you play them. For example, you might feel pressured to play an offensive role in a multiplayer game by the community, when in reality you enjoy healing much more. If you find healing fun, be a healer! You are playing for yourself, not to please other people. The same thing goes for difficulty levels. You might feel ashamed for playing on the easiest level- don’t be! If that’s fun to you, that is all that matters.

                        <p>2. Take a break.
                            You’ve probably heard this one before from your parents or other adults in your life. You’ve probably wanted to ignore it too- at GG, we know how frustrating it can be when other things get in the way of gaming, and we totally understand the desire to pull an all nighter. However, too much of anything can be detrimental to your physical and mental health! Make sure to take breaks, move around, eat full, balanced meals and drink lots of water. This will keep your body healthy and also improve your brain power, focus level and reaction time - all important in gaming! This will also help you maintain your mental health. We are not designed to do one thing obsessively for hours on end. Your brain needs a break too! Try going for a walk, drawing, reading or something else that you enjoy (maybe even homework). You’ll find that gaming is much more fun when you have limits on the times you can play. It makes those times worth it.

                        <p>3. Play with friends!
                            Although not every game allows for multiplayer, sharing time with your friends can be an awesome and fun way to play video games. Stressful team games can become more fun and lighthearted. There is also a stronger sense of trust when you play with people you know. For games that aren’t multiplayer, you can still talk about your experiences with friends or find an online community. Watching gamers on Twitch or Youtube is also a great way to connect. Not only can you learn a lot from other people, but you can make meaningful connections with those who have a similar interest to you.
