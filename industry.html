                <h1>The Industry</h1>
                    <h2>The industry is big and ominous, and can be a terrifying thing to consider for interested gamers.</h2>
                        <p>1. Contact! This one may seem obvious, but connection is one of the most important things in the gaming industry. Whether you want to be a programmer or an artist, knowing people who work in the industry can help you learn from them and gather valuable information about the reality of the gaming world. Get involved in online communities such as Reddit, Forums and Discord. The friends you make might be your coworkers later in life!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
                        <div class="bigquote"><h3>"The internet is full of online tutorials that can teach you a lot about your chosen field."</h3></div>
        <div class="articlepage">
            <div class="articlecol">
                        <p>2. Research! Again, this one seems obvious. But the gaming world is absolutely massive and there are so many different paths to go down. What does your favourite gaming publisher actually do? What is the real job of a concept artist? What is the difference between an Indie and a “triple A” company? Be thorough when researching and try to find out as much as you can about the industry before you are sure that it is the direction you want to go in. For example, game programmers don’t get to sit around all day and play games (as awesome as that would be)
                        </p>

            <div class="articlecol">
                        <p>3. Education! You don’t need formal education to get into the games industry. Why not start now? The internet is full of online tutorials that can teach you a lot about your chosen field. Youtube is a great resource, and there are several free programs available depending on what you want to do. Getting a head start on your education will pay off in the long run, and give you more confidence moving forward. There is always so much to learn!
