                <h1>ONLINE SAFETY</h1>
                    <h2>The gaming world can be a dangerous place for people of all ages.</h2>
                        <p>Gaming is an awesome way to meet new people and learn valuable skills. However, we are often not aware of the full extent to which we expose ourselves online. Racism, sexism, hate speech, bigotry, bullying, and discrimination are just a few of the things players face online. Many of us are aware that the cruel words of others cannot physically hurt us, but they can ruin our playing experience. We are also at risk to cyber attacks and having our personal information exploited. It does not make you stupid to “fall” for a scam; the gaming world is full of people who make a living off hurting other people. Learning about your rights and what you can do in a situation can help protect us online. </p>

        <div class="articlepage">
            <div class="articlecol">
                        <p>There are so many different things we can do to help protect ourselves. Many game publishers (such as EA, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard etc) allow users to keep their real name and date of birth private from other players. You can also control who sees your profile and who can send you messages. Why is this important? Hate speech isn’t always easily ignored and can seriously damage your mental health. By putting barriers in place to stop hate speech, we can make the gaming world a safer space automatically. Another thing to be aware of is voice chat in game. Other players can make cruel comments towards you, and the best thing to do is block/ mute and report. Muting them will make your experience better, and reporting means that the player is less likely to hurt others. </p>
